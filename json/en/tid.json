Once you have unlocked all rewards of a certain type, for example Rare Brawlers, the probability to get all other rewards increases. Luck: In order to make the Brawl Box opening experience fairer there is a luck system affecting the probability of Legendary Brawlers. With each draw that doesn't give you a new Brawler, your luck value is increased, and each time you get a new Brawler, your luck value goes down based on the rarity of the Brawler you got. When luck is high enough, you have a greater chance to get a Legendary Brawler, while a low luck value means that it's harder to get a new Legendary Brawler.
